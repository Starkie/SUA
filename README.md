# SUA-AutonomousCar
An autonomous car prototype for the subject Sistemas Ubicuos Adaptativos of the MITSS master.

It is implemented as an adaptive system using a (reduced) MAPE-K loop. The car is able to reconfigure itself in face of changes of its execution context: the status of the road, the status of the driver, its current configuration, etc.

## How to execute it:
1. Import all the projects in src into the workspace.
1. Import the launch settings from the `src/launch_settings` folder. In Eclipse: File > Import > Run/Debug configurations
3. Run the project.
  -  For instructions on how to interact with the simulator, check the chapter 6 of the `docs/AutonomousCar - Parte 1 - Descripcion del Escenario y Prototipo.pdf` document.
